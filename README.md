## :sunrise_over_mountains: Future Plans

1. **Artificial Intelligence Coach:** In the future, we plan to incorporate a sophisticated AI coach that will adapt the workout plans according to your progress, provide real-time feedback on your form during workouts, and offer dynamic adjustments to your routine.

2. **Virtual Reality Workouts:** We are also looking at the possibility of integrating Virtual Reality (VR) into the workout sessions. With VR, you will be able to experience a variety of workout environments from the comfort of your home. This could range from a calm yoga session on a beach to a high-intensity workout in a bustling cityscape.
